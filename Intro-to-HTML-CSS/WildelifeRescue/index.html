               <p>Welcome to Wild Rescue. Our mission is to rescue, rehabilitate, and release wildlife back into their natural environment.
                 We are a nonprofit organization dedicated to helping injured wildlife.</p>
                <p>Our staff provides around-the-clock care for wildlife in need. We also provide longterm care for wildlife that cannot be
                released back into their natural environment.
                </p>
                <p>Will you partner with us? We need volunteers to help care for our animals. You can also donate, become a member, or become
